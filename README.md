# Project TutorGPT
My goal is to build a locally-run LLM that uses RAG to provided textbook-specific support to learners.

This is quite a big project and one that involves many tools and technologies that I have not used before, so it will likely be under development for quite a while.

The first step is to build a program to accurately pull out the text, tables, and images from a pdf page of a textbook. I'll have to focus on accuracy as this is the information that will eventually be entered into a vector database for our model to reference when prompted.
